# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 About the Organization

LAPPIS, a Brazilian FOSS lab led by women, is dedicated to fostering collaboration and engagement in OSS. Our mission is to increase the participation of young South Americans, women, and other underrepresented groups in high-impact open-source projects. We aim to overcome barriers such as language, impostor syndrome, and inclusion.
We have established several OSS local communities, including one focused on a chatbot architecture trained in Portuguese and another on a social participation app called "Empurrando Juntas." This app collects opinions and utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to group participants based on their views.
Our flagship project, "Brasil Participativo," is a collaboration with the federal government and the Brazilian Decidim Community, serving as Brazil's digital participation platform. In just one year, the platform has engaged over 1.5 million active participants, making it the largest online social participation initiative orchestrated by the government in Brazil. Developed using Decidim, an open framework for citizen participation, the platform includes machine learning modules for recommendations and moderation.
Brasil Participativo, powered by Decidim, enables national councils, ministries, and federal agencies to conduct inclusive public consultations. This creates a space for citizens to actively contribute to the formulation of decrees, ordinances, and other critical actions. Decidim, managed by the Decidim Free Software Association, serves as the democratic backbone of this initiative, empowering communities and fostering a culture of collaborative governance.
As we look to the future, Brasil Participativo, fueled by Decidim, remains a beacon of digital empowerment. It invites individuals to create profiles and actively engage in shaping the policies that affect their lives.
Engaging individuals from diverse backgrounds in participation platforms is a global challenge. This involves offering clear and meaningful participatory processes that address people's everyday problems. It's also essential to simplify the choice architectures so participants can easily understand how to contribute, reducing barriers such as the number of clicks and the complexity of interfaces.
Other challenges include addressing performance issues with the Decidim platform, simplifying the user experience, implementing new features, and utilizing machine learning modules for monitoring guidance.


## 1.2 About the project

One critical prerequisite for the Brasil Participativo platform is to ensure universal citizen participation. This presents a significant technopolitical challenge in a country marked by pronounced social and educational disparities, where various segments of the population face obstacles in engaging with virtual environments. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in participatory platforms that enable organizations to engage with their communities effectively. These platforms facilitate two-way communication, allowing organizations to gather feedback, crowdsource ideas, and collaborate with their stakeholders. Building on the success and experience of the Brasil Participativo initiative, we propose to develop a boilerplate that will enable organizations to create their own participatory platforms easily.
The project will focus on creating a basic boilerplate that includes essential features such as user authentication, participatory spaces, user experience. The boilerplate will be designed to be scalable and extensible, allowing organizations to add additional features as needed. By developing a participatory platform boilerplate based on Brasil Participativo, we aim to empower organizations to engage with their communities in a meaningful and impactful way. This project aligns with our commitment to promoting transparency, inclusivity, and democratic participation. Some tasks necessary:
Develop a customizable and easy-to-deploy boilerplate based on the principles and features of Brasil Participativo. Provide organizations with a tool to create participatory platforms tailored to their needs.
Promote transparency, engagement, and collaboration between organizations and their stakeholder.

Expected size of the project: 350 hours

# 3 Proposal Timeline

## 3.1 Bonding Period 

### 3.1.1 Before March 29:
To familiarize myself completely with Ruby and Rails Framework. 
The functionalities and architecture of Decidim.
Study the Brasil Participativo Platform. 
To contribute to the community solving and issue.
Write a draft of the proposal to go over with mentors and ask questions.

### 3.1.2 April 02 – May 01 (Before the official coding time):

To do self coding with Ruby on Rails to improve my further understanding and ease of use with this ORM and database(PostgreSQL).
During this period I will remain in constant touch with my mentor and the community. I will remain active on Telegram to discuss and finalize on the modifications (if any) that needs to be on existing schemas and design of new schemas (if needed to fit cleanly with Decidim and Brasil Participativo Architecture)
Thus with the help of my mentor I will become absolutely clear about my future goals,the final database implementations that need to be done as well as the approach that I will follow.
